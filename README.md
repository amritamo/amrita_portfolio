## Projects

### GetHealth
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/FoodRec)

Developed a mobile application using Expo frontend and Flask backend to help users manage their diet and make informed food choices. The app employs computer vision to identify foods in a refrigerator, retrieves their nutritional information, and recommends meals based on user-defined macronutrient goals.

### Graded Sentiment Analysis of Yelp Reviews
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/INFO-159/tree/cd9af9482516461c041770994077057c0168a7ad/Annotation%20Project)

Developed an ordinal regression model to classify Yelp review data based on passion levels, achieving a 15.8% improvement over the baseline accuracy, through effective feature engineering. The project involved detailed analysis of punctuation, text length, and capitalization to enhance model performance and address challenges in distinguishing passion levels.

### Fashion Synthesis Tool
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/fashion_stable_diffusion_finetuned.git)

Fine-tuned KerasCV Stable Diffusion model on fashion dataset using low-rank adaptation, enhancing text-to-image results for this context. Conducted a performance analysis of several variables including LoRA rank, batch size, and learning rate. Evaluated the model outputs by implementing Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to assess generated image quality compared to baselines.

### Facial Keypoint Detection

Optimized ResNet-28 architecture for full facial keypoint detection of ibug face dataset. Implemented U-Net architecture for pixelwise classification, generating pixel-aligned heatmaps to predict facial keypoints.
