## Work Experience

**Computer Vision Researcher @ Aravind Eye Hospitals, Remote (_November 2024 - current_)**
- Achieved 95% validation accuracy for glaucoma detection by enhancing and fine-tuning VGG19 and EfficientNet-B0 architectures on internal retinal fundus datasets.
- Pre-processed and cleaned data to ensure high-quality input and optimize model performance.
- Collaborated with doctors across 14 eye hospitals to align models with clinical requirements and ensure practical applicability.

**Software Engineering Intern @ Senvo, Berlin, DE (_June 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Automated invoice data parsing by integrating and unit testing the Google Cloud Document AI API, reducing
processing time by 50%.
- Deployed anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, k-Nearest Neighbors) to identify and correct discrepancies in client data entry with 97% accuracy, significantly improving overall data consistency.

**Co-founder @ Reazi LLC., Berkeley, CA (_July 2022 - February 2023_)**
- Collaborated with a 6-member cross-functional team at the Berkeley SkyDeck startup incubator to develop a
rental platform connecting college students and landlords.
- Designed and deployed a RESTful API server using FastAPI and Docker, leveraging SQLAlchemy to define user
and listing schemas with PostgreSQL.
- Delivered a product viability pitch deck to VCs, securing early-stage interest.
   
**Undergraduate Researcher @ SKY Lab, Berkeley, CA (_June 2022 - December 2022_)**
- Reduced floater artifacts in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) through temporal averaging of multi-frame data, measured by a 10% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), resulting in more accurate 3D scene reconstruction.
- Rendered 8K synthetic data in Blender for the purpose of training neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for 360-degree videos.


**Engineering Intern @ Syntiant Corp., Irvine, CA (_June 2021 - August 2021_)**
- Deployed Mobilenet-V3 TensorFlow Lite Model for image classification to benchmark Syntiant NDP120 Neural Decision Processor performance against Raspberry Pi 3 ARM Cortex-A53 & Raspberry Pi 4 ARM Cortex-A72 processors, showing 30x more inferences/million cycles and 100x energy efficiency improvement compared to baselines.
- Developed a framework to collect, analyze, and visualize power consumption data, showcasing a 1-year runtime compared to just 3 days for the baseline processor.

## Projects

### Mental Health Sentiment Classifier (November 2024 - December 2024)
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/mental-health-bert)

Fine-tuned BERT for classification of mental well-being indicators in social media text, achieving 83% accuracy—outperforming Random Forest, Linear SVM, and Logistic Regression baseline models trained with TF-IDF vectorization. 

### GetHealth (June 2024 - August 2024)
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/FoodRec)
The Smart Fridge Food Recommender is a mobile application that uses YOLOv5, an object detection model to identify foods inside a refrigerator, fetches their nutritional information, and recommends meals based on the user’s macronutrient goals. This project aims to provide a convenient way for users to manage their diet and make informed food choices.


### Fashion Synthesis Tool (November 2023 - December 2023)
[Github Repo](https://github.com/amritamo/fashion_stable_diffusion_finetuned.git)

Created a text-to-image GenAI fashion tool by fine-tuning KerasCV Stable Diffusion model on the Fashion Product Dataset using low-rank adaptation. Conducted an ablation study of several variables including LoRA rank, batch size, and learning rate. Achieved a 37% reduction in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), generating more realistic images compared to the baseline model.

### NewsByte (March 2023 - May 2023)
[Demo App](https://newsbyte-mobile.netlify.app/)

Developed a React-based mobile app with a Node.js backend to deliver concise news updates through text-to-speech and GPT-3.5-based summarization. Integrated NewsAPI and HTML scraping to fetch news from diverse sources, providing users with audio and text-based options; hosted the app on Netlify for seamless deployment and access.
